The frontend, built with TypeScript and Konva.js, renders an interactive map that updates live via a Java WebSocket server. The system's backend features a distributed architecture: a standalone Java application processes data telegrams from PLCs and updates a MySQL database (using JPA/Hibernate) via a WildFly-hosted REST API. This API also provides additional data to the web app and exposes special controller functions via JMI and JMX.",
